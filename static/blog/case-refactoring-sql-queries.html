<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
  An administrating application included an "advanced search" query for finding routes.
  There were around 10 search criteria that could be combined together. Also this query
  was "touching" around 10 tables in the database.
</p>

<p>
  Previous code was looking something like the code below:
</p>

<pre><code lang="java">

public class OperatorController {

  @Autowired
  private OperatorRepository operatorRepository;

  public List<Operator> search() {
    if (!nameInputField.isEmpty() && !classificationField.isEmpty() && !availabilityField.isEmpty()) {
      return operatorRepository.findByNameAndClassificationAndAvailability(nameInputField,
	    classificationField, availabilityField);
	} else if (!nameInputField.isEmpty() && !classificationField.isEmpty()) {
      return operatorRepository.findByNameAndClassification(nameInputField, classificationField);
    } else if (!nameInputField.isEmpty()) {
      return operatorRepository.findByName
    } else {
      return Collections.emptyList();
    }
  }
}
	
</code></pre>

<p>
  Different combinations were causing writing a unique query and adding a new "if" clause
  in code. Removing / Adding search criteria was quite hard and took much time
</p>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<h3>Introduce service bean</h3>

<p>
  The first thing that was clear to me was to separate controller from service logic.
  I tried to ban all repository beans from controllers and introduce a service bean
  between them. This way, I could list all operations on Operator domain object into
  a single bean
</p>

<p>
  The method would look now like this: 
</p>


<pre><code lang="java">

public class OperatorService {

  private final OperatorRepository operatorRepository;

  @Autowired
  public OperatorService(final OperatorRepository operatorRepository) {
    this.operatorRepository = operatorRepository;
  }

  public List<Operator> search(final Map&lt;String, Serializable&gt; fields) {
    if (fields.contains("name") && fields.contains("classification") && fields.contains("availability")) {
      final Classification classification = (Classification) fields.get("classification");
      final Availability availability = (Availability) fields.get("availability");
      final String name = fields.get("name").toString();	
      return operatorRepository.findByNameAndClassificationAndAvailability(name,
        classification, availability);	
    }
  }

}
	
</code></pre>

<p>
  In the beginning I moved all fields into a simple map. If clauses were still infecting
  the service bean, but I separated business logic from the UI at least
</p>

<h3>Extendable queries</h3>

<p>
  The main reason that I had to keep the "if" clauses were actual boundaries in the way
  we were writing SQL queries with JPA and @Query annotations. After some research I
  crossed upon the JPA Metamodel and criteria as a way to programmatically write
  all SQL queries
</p>

<p>
  After some tests and experiments I noticed that JPA criteria were relatively complicated
  and not straight-forward. For fun and profit, I decided to create my own way on top of
  this solution. My goal was to write something like this:
</p>

<pre><code lang="java">

select().from(OperatorEntity.class).where(OperatorEntity_.name).isEqualToIgnoreCase("test").findOne();

</code></pre>
