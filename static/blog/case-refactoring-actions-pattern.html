<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  At the company I was working there was a specific application and "mechanism" for
  performing specific decisions / actions. These actions had several conditions in order to
  be invoked and it more than one action could be performed with a single one.
</p>

<p>
  The tech team was having before issues with the code related with this feature. They did the
  following refactoring:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moved all action into the database</li>
  <li>Created a UI for administrating these actions</li>
  <li>An action could also belong to a group</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
  Adapting and refactoring this solution had a great impact in the database and
  all actions. A single renaming / refactoring on the database schema needed
  to update all queries stored in the tables. This refactoring took me over 3 days to find and
  adapt all queries stored
</p>

<pre><code lang="sql">

action
-------------------
id | action_name  |
---+--------------+
 1 | open network |
---+--------------+

action_sql
---+------------------------------------------------+
id | acton_sql                                      |
---+------------------------------------------------+
 1 | UPDATE network SET enabled = 1 WHERE ID = :1   |
 2 | UPDATE operator SET enabled = 1 WHERE ID = :2  |
---+------------------------------------------------+

action_action_sql
---+-----------+---------------+
id | action_id | action_sql_id |
---+-----------+---------------+
 1 | 1         | 1             |
 2 | 1         | 2             |
---+-----------+---------------+

</code></pre>

<p>
  The schema above seems easy at first sight, but after we add 50 actions with over 200 SQL queries
  and many groups and inter-dependencies, it becomes very hard to maintain since all adaptations need
  to be done in the database.
</p>

<p>
  At the end, developers built a UI in order to maintain this database schema. But still, changes in actions
  took days and maintainability was low.
</p>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<h3>1st  step - Define business code</h3>

<p>
  I was definitely sure that I needed to find a solution that SQL queries should go back
  in the source code and services bean.  This way the code and backend will translate all
  operations in the database into real business operations. Instead of maintaining
</p>

<pre>
<code lang="sql">
UPDATE operator SET enabled = false WHERE ID = 1;
</code>
</pre>

<p>We should wrap this query into reusable code</p>

<pre>
<code lang="Java">
public interface OperatorService {

  /**
   * Disable a specific operator by ID
   */
  void  disableById(final Long id);

}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>2nd step - The actions mechanism</h3>

<p>
  After understanding that actions could also include "sub-actions" inside them, I started
  thinking about the command pattern. This will allow me to write composite commands
  and organize code much better.
</p>

<pre>
<code lang="java">
public interface NetworkAction {

	@NonNull
	String getLabel();

	boolean supports(@NonNull final Network network);

	void execute(@NonNull final Network network);
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>
  The <i>supports</i> method checks if the action is available for the network provided.
  A simple implementation of the interface above would be the following:
</p>

<pre>
<code>

@Component
public class DisableNetworkAction implements NetworkAction {

	private final NetworkService networkService;

	@Override
	public String getLabel() {
		return "Disable network";
	}


	public DisableNetworkAction(final NetworkService networkService) {
		this.networkService = networkService;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean supports(final Network network) {
		return !network.isDisabled();
	}

	@Override
	public void execute(Network network) {
		networkService.disableById(network.getId());
	}

}

</code>
</pre>

<p>
  This pattern used differs actually from the command pattern, since all actions
  are stateless. The good part is that this way I can use dependency injection
  and organize my beans. The bad part is that rollback cannot be implemented and
  was removed.
</p>

<p>
  The fact was that rollback was not used anymore by users and all actions were
  "circular" and someone could revert changes by actions. This way I was able
  to convince business to remove this feature
</p>

<h3>3rd step - conditions builder</h3>

<p>
  After building complicated actions I noticed that the conditions were getting
  complicated with many sub conditions and over 5 lines of boolean expressions.
  In order to make this more readable, I tried to utilize a <b>builder</b> for
  conditions to transform expressions into a domain-specific language.
</p>

<p>
  After refactoring, a complicated action was looking like the example below:
</p>

<pre><code lang="java">
public class ShutdownNetworkAction implements NetworkAction {

	private final SetStatusClosedNetworkAction setStatusClosedNetworkAction;
	private final DisableNetworkAction disableNetworkAction;

	@Autowired
	public ShutdownNetworkAction(final SetStatusClosedNetworkAction setStatusClosedNetworkAction, final DisableNetworkAction disableNetworkAction) {
		this.disableNetworkAction = disableNetworkAction;
		this.setStatusClosedNetworkAction = setStatusClosedNetworkAction;
	}

	@Override
	public String getLabel() {
		return "Shutdown network";
	}

	@Override
	public boolean supports(Network network) {
		return ConditionBuilder.create(network)
				.isValid()
				.supportAll(disableNetworkAction, setStatusClosedNetworkAction)
				.build();
	}

	@Override
	public void execute(Network network) {
		setStatusClosedNetworkAction.execute(network);
		disableNetworkAction.execute(network);
	}

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  Here are few thoughts from what I learned from this refactoring
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business code belongs in services and need to be reusable</li>
  <li>No queries shall be stored in database schema.</li>
  <li>
    If data are not modified by end-users, maybe it is not a good idea to
    store them in database.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <b>command pattern</b> can help a lot when actions can be composite
    and consist of more sub-actions
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Builder pattern</b> can help you build your own domain-specific language
  </li>

<p>
  After introducing these refactorings, it became very easy to introduce changes
  in datbase. All changes were isolated in Entity beans and maybe in a Service
  bean (maximum in 2-3 classes). Actions were adaptable and easy to modify.
  Building new complicated actions was as much fun as building with Lego bricks
</p>

<p>
  The most important lesson is being careful with refactoring. This part was
  redesigned in the past 2 times already. Before introducing breaking changes
  into code, it needs to be tested first and covered and then think twice if
  it will really bring benefits in code
</p>
