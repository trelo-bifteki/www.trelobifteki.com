<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  At the company I was working there was a specific application and "mechanism" for
  performing specific decisions / actions. These actions had several conditions in order to
  be invoked and it more than one action could be performed with a single one.
</p>

<p>
  The tech team was having issues with the code related with this feature. They did the
  following refactoring:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moved all action into the database</li>
  <li>Created a UI for administrating these actions</li>
  <li>An action could also belong to a group</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
  Adapting and refactoring this solution had a great impact in the database and
  all actions. A single renaming / refactoring on the database schema needed
  to update all queries stored in the tables
</p>
