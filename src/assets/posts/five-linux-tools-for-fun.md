## sl (steam locomotive)

This is a very old application that I learned at the university. It displays 
an animation of a steam locomotive every time you type by mistake `sl` instead
of `ls`. It is also not possible to interrupt the animation and you need to
wait until the locomotive gets off the screen. Nowadays it can be pretty long
with all these high definitions screens and terminals

	apt install sl
